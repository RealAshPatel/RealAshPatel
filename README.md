- 👋 Hey, I'm the TheAsh
- 👀 I’m i'm interested in equity - fairness and equality that leaves no room and makes no excuse for harrassmennt, abuse, and attack by autocratic states.
- 🌱 About addiction, mental health and how to get back to being myself after an appalling year in which I went to edge more than a few times
- 💞️ I’m looking to finding ways to express meaningful ideas through content and art
- 📫 How to reach me. It'll get easier? I've gone through three routers, five phones, six laptops - in our remote house. Thank God - I'm exhausted.
- ✨ I'm so greatful for the support of my colleagues, my wife and my three amazing daughters - they struggled to see their Dad turn into a shodow. They have been
steadfast and resilient. Progress bends freedom - and there can be no freedom where there is truck with despots. I have never claimed to be neutral.
